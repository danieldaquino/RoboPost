/*======
~~lineCruise~~

Starts to cruise on a line at a specified speed.

MAKE SURE TO INITIALIZE THE LINE CRUISER FIRST!

inputs:
	(float) speed: The desired speed, in cm/s
	(char) desiredPath: The desired path. 0 is left, 1 is right.
outputs:
	(char) Return Status:	0 means ok
							1 means too fast
							2 means curvature too small
Globals affected:  Line sensor, chosenPath,	Timer A0, Timer A2, eventually Motor pins.
======*/
char lineCruise(float speed, char desiredPath);

/*======
~~lineCruiserInit~~

Initializes the line cruiser.

MAKE SURE THE SCHEDULER IS INITIALIZED BEFORE CALLING THIS FUNCTION

inputs: none
outputs:
	(char) Return Status:	0 means ok
							1 means failed
Globals affected:  Line sensor,	Timer A0, Timer A2, eventually the motor pins, Scheduler call stack
